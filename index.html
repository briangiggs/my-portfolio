            <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>I am just an ordinary person learning to code so that one day, I can build my own Saas.</p>

        <p>I am currently a student in university doing a course in Civil Engineering. I know that this career will not give me the freedom that i desire so I am turning to technology by learning to build softwares for businesses that need it.</p>

        <p>This is my first project, I am determined to build others as fast as I can.</p>

        <p>I believe building projects will teach me more than learning form tutorials.</p>
